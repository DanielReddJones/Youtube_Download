<h2>Installing Pytube</h2>
<p>
To install Pytube, make sure that you have Python's package manager. To do this, run pip --version. If it returns a version number, run the following command:
<i><b>python3 -m pip install pytube</b></i><br>
If it does not, run <i><b>"sudo apt-get install python3-pip."</b></i> This will install it onto your computer. If you are not running a Debian-based system, use the package manager that came with your system.
</p>

<h2>TKinter</h2>
<p>
Normally, Tkinter is packaged with Python by default. However in some cases you might not have it installed. If this is the case, download tkinter using your package manager. On Debian-based systems, run the following command:
<i><b>sudo apt-get install python3-tk</b></i>
